The user wants to create a fully offline-capable mobile application named Oniks EKS APP for executing SSH commands on Raspberry Pi devices. The app's UI is dynamically configured from a remote JSON file. The user explicitly stated a requirement for the app to function without an internet connection after the initial configuration is fetched and for SSH commands to be executed directly from the device, eliminating the need for a backend server.

Initially, I focused on UI/UX improvements, such as vertically centering content on the settings screen and displaying configuration load/update timestamps. I also added the application logo for Android and iOS.

The main challenge arose when the user requested an APK build. My attempts at a local build failed due to environment limitations (ARM64 architecture causing AAPT2 errors). We then pivoted to using Expo Application Services (EAS) Build. This process was also fraught with difficulties, including user credential issues and build failures related to native module linking (), which is incompatible with the Expo managed workflow.

The user reiterated the critical need for a fully offline-capable app, leading to the decision to remove the backend dependency and implement a native SSH solution. This path also hit a roadblock because native modules require ejecting from the Expo managed workflow, which complicated the build process significantly, leading to further failures.

The last interaction confirmed the user wants a clean, backend-less build via EAS, but build errors persist, likely due to leftover native code configurations in the GitHub repository.

The user's preferred language is Turkish. The next agent must respond in Turkish.

The objective is to develop a React Native mobile application, Oniks EKS APP, enabling users to execute SSH commands on Raspberry Pi devices. The application's user interface, including buttons and pages, must be dynamically configured by fetching a remote JSON file. A primary requirement is for the app to be fully functional offline after the initial configuration download; it must cache the configuration locally. SSH commands must be executable directly from the mobile device over a local WiFi network without relying on an external backend server. The app should also feature a settings screen to refresh the configuration or clear all data, a branded splash screen, and a responsive UI that correctly handles safe areas on both iOS and Android devices.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack (Initial):** React Native (Expo) frontend with a FastAPI backend.
- **Offline-First (Target):** The architecture is being refactored to remove the backend dependency.
- **Native SSH Execution:** Intended to use a native module like  for direct SSH connections, but this proved incompatible with the Expo managed workflow.
- **UI:** Dynamic UI rendering from JSON,  for navigation,  for layout.
- **Build System:** Expo Application Services (EAS) Build for creating the final APK.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub are used for source code management.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with a  Expo application. The initial backend was in a separate directory but has been deprecated in favor of a backend-less, native SSH architecture.

**Directory Structure (Target):**


- ****
    - **Importance:** Allows users to manage their configuration.
    - **Changes:** Refactored to remove filename editing. UI was vertically centered. Functionality was added to display the configuration's initial load date and last update date.
- ****
    - **Importance:** Handles the initial fetching and saving of the remote JSON configuration.
    - **Changes:** Updated to store the  timestamp along with the configuration data in local storage. The dependency on the backend proxy for fetching the JSON was removed.
- ****
    - **Importance:** Responsible for running SSH commands.
    - **Changes:** This file was the center of the refactoring effort. The initial implementation used  to call a backend endpoint. It was modified to attempt using a native SSH module, which failed. The current state is likely reverted to the backend-dependent version pending a successful native build strategy.
- ****
    - **Importance:** Core configuration file for the Expo app, defining metadata, plugins, and build settings.
    - **Changes:** The  and  properties were updated to use the new . An  was added for EAS builds. The file was edited multiple times to add and then remove a config plugin () during failed build attempts.
- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages project dependencies.
    - **Changes:** Attempts were made to add SSH libraries like , which caused build conflicts and were subsequently removed.

<pending_tasks>
- Successfully build a functional APK that meets all user requirements, especially the offline SSH execution capability.
- Resolve persistent EAS build failures, which are likely caused by residual misconfigurations or native code remnants in the GitHub repository.
- Implement a working native SSH solution that is compatible with the build environment and Expo framework.

<current_work>
The current and primary focus is to produce a functional Android APK of the Oniks EKS APP. The user has firmly re-established the requirement for a completely backend-less application that can execute SSH commands directly from the device, even when offline (on a local network).

My last actions revolved around attempting to achieve this via Expo Application Services (EAS) Build, using the user's public GitHub repository () as the source. We encountered a series of  errors. The most recent attempt also failed, indicating a problem during the  task, pointing to unresolved references. This strongly suggests that despite efforts to clean the project, remnants of the failed native SSH module integration (like  or  folder references) are still present or the project's native Android files are out of sync.

The immediate task before this summary was advising the user to perform a thorough cleanup of their GitHub repository by deleting the  and  folders and ensuring  does not contain any native SSH dependencies, then re-attempting the EAS build.

<optional_next_step>
I will verify the user has cleaned their GitHub repository by removing the  and  folders and any SSH-related dependencies from . Then, I will guide them to trigger one more EAS build from the Expo dashboard.
