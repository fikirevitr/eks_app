The user, communicating in Turkish, requested a mobile application named Oniks EKS APP. The primary goal is to execute SSH commands on Raspberry Pi devices through a dynamically configured UI. The configuration, including buttons, SSH credentials, and commands, is fetched from a remote JSON file.

The development process involved setting up a full-stack application using Expo (React Native) for the frontend and FastAPI (Python) for the backend. A key architectural decision was to create a backend proxy to handle SSH connections. This was done for security and to overcome cross-platform limitations, using  for SSH and  to prevent blocking the async event loop.

Numerous features and fixes were implemented based on user feedback:
- A dynamic, multi-page UI with customizable buttons from a JSON config.
- A backend proxy to fetch the user's external JSON, bypassing CORS issues.
- A platform-aware storage wrapper ( for web,  for mobile).
- A branded splash screen and logo integration.
- Extensive debugging of React infinite loops (Maximum update depth exceeded), backend performance (removing  flag), and mobile-specific issues (Safe Area, Worklets).
- UI/UX refinements, such as automatically appending  to filenames and adding contact information.

The conversation's primary language is Turkish. The next agent must respond in Turkish.

The most recent task was to simplify the Settings screen by removing the ability for the user to edit the configuration filename, leaving only options to refresh the current config or clear all data. This task was in progress when the conversation ended.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a modern, animated React Native mobile application, Oniks EKS APP, that allows users to execute SSH commands on Raspberry Pi devices.

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The app's UI (buttons, pages, colors, icons) must be dynamically configured by fetching a JSON file from a URL.
2.  **Initial Setup:** On first launch, the user provides a filename (e.g., ). The app combines this with a base URL () and appends  to fetch the configuration.
3.  **SSH Command Execution:** Buttons on the UI, when pressed, trigger predefined SSH commands on target devices specified in the JSON. A backend service handles the SSH connection.
4.  **Offline Capability:** The fetched configuration must be cached locally so the app remains functional without an internet connection.
5.  **Multi-Page UI:** Buttons can be grouped into different pages using a  in the JSON, with tabs for navigation.
6.  **Settings:** An in-app settings screen allows the user to refresh the current configuration from its source or clear all local data to return to the initial setup screen.

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- A branded splash screen is displayed for 3 seconds on startup.
- The UI must be responsive, working on both phones and tablets, and correctly handle safe areas (status and navigation bars).
- Error messages (e.g., SSH connection failed) should be user-friendly and in Turkish.
- The app should not lock up if an SSH command fails.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** React Native (Expo) frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend.
- **SSH Execution:**  library on the backend to execute commands.
- **Asynchronous Backend:** FastAPI with  to prevent blocking SSH calls from freezing the application.
- **CORS Workaround:** A backend proxy endpoint was created to fetch the user's external JSON config, avoiding browser-based cross-origin restrictions.
- **State Management:** React Hooks (, , ) and .
- **Local Storage:** A custom wrapper () abstracts  (mobile) and  (web).
- **UI:** Dynamic rendering from JSON,  for proper layout,  for external URLs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with  and  directories. The backend is a FastAPI server, and the frontend is an Expo (React Native) application using file-based routing with .

**Directory Structure:**


**File-specific details:**

- ****
    - **Importance:** The core of the backend. It serves the FastAPI application, provides a proxy endpoint to fetch external JSON configs (solving CORS issues), and an  endpoint to execute SSH commands using  in a non-blocking way.
    - **Changes:** Initially synchronous, it was refactored to use  to prevent app lock-ups. Error handling was improved to return user-friendly, Turkish error messages. A performance issue caused by a  flag in the supervisor config was identified and fixed.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The app's entry point. It now serves as the splash screen.
    - **Changes:** Initially a simple redirect, it was refactored to display a branded splash screen for 3 seconds. It then checks if a configuration exists in local storage and navigates either to  or . This fixed a refresh loop issue.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The initial configuration screen where the user enters their JSON filename.
    - **Changes:** UI was refined to only ask for the filename (auto-appends ), placeholder text was improved, and a linked contact info box was added. It uses the backend proxy to fetch the config.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main dashboard. It dynamically renders pages and buttons based on the loaded JSON configuration.
    - **Changes:** Styling for page tabs and buttons was made more compact and responsive. A header logo was added.  and  were added to respect device notches and navigation bars.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Displays the status and output of an SSH command execution.
    - **Changes:** A critical Maximum update depth exceeded infinite loop was fixed by correcting  dependencies and using .  was added. Error display was improved to show translated messages from the backend.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Allows the user to manage their configuration.
    - **Changes:** This file underwent significant changes. A bug preventing the Clear Data confirmation dialog from appearing on the web was addressed. A Network Error on mobile was fixed by ensuring the  constant was correctly scoped. The most recent work involves simplifying the UI to remove the input for changing the filename.

- ****
    - **Importance:** A crucial abstraction layer created to handle data persistence.
    - **Changes:** This file was created to provide a unified storage API, using  on the web and  on mobile, solving web compatibility issues.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Web Clear Data Dialog:** The confirmation dialog () for the Tüm Verileri Temizle button on the settings page was still not appearing for the user on the web preview, preventing the feature from being used.
- **Finalize Settings Page UI:** The refactoring of the settings page to remove the filename input field was in progress and needs to be completed and tested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate last task was a user-requested simplification of the **** screen. The requirement was to remove the ability for the user to edit the configuration filename from this page.

The intended final state for the Settings screen is:
1.  Display the currently loaded configuration filename as read-only text.
2.  Provide a Mevcut Konfigürasyonu Yenile (Refresh Current Configuration) button.
3.  Provide a Tüm Verileri Temizle (Clear All Data) button that prompts for confirmation and then navigates back to the setup screen.

The AI engineer had started this refactoring by removing the  function and the  state, and was in the process of removing the corresponding JSX elements (the  and the Güncelle button). The task was interrupted before completing the UI cleanup and testing the revised functionality. The file  is currently in a partially-edited, non-functional state.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Complete the refactoring of  by removing the unused UI elements (input field, update button), then restart the Expo server and verify the new, simplified settings screen functions as requested.
